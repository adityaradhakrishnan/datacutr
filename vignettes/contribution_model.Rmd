# Introduction 

This vignette gives you an overview of the anticipated contribution model.
The goal is to enable users of `{datacutr}` to contribute and test the contribution model for `{datacutr}`. Adjustments might be made over time.

# Basics
 * For each new contribution, the user creates an issue on the issue tab on [GitHub](https://github.com/pharmaverse/datacutr/issues) to put it in our backlog. 
 
 * All [created issues](https://github.com/pharmaverse/datcutr/issues) will be reviewed within the next sprint and the creator will receive an initial feedback via a comment. Someone from the core development team will then triage new issues by assigning the appropriate labels (such as “user request” so we can easily identify new requests).
 
 * Issues are meant to be taken on by users from the Pharma programming
 community and not exclusively by the `{datacutr}` team from Roche.

# Contribution Model

Type 1 Contribution with Code: 

 * First, the user creates an issue or comments on an existing issue to notify that they’d like to contribute code.
 
 * Follow our [development process](development_process.html) step-by-step guide.
 
 * We advise to contact an `{datacutr}` core development team directly.


Type 2 Contribution without Code: 

 * User creates an issue and ideally contacts an `{datcutr}` team member.
 
 * The `{datacutr}` core development team will contact the issue creator as soon as possible to discuss further details.
