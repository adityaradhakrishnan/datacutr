# Main Idea

The main idea of `{datacutr}` is...

## Load Packages and Example Datasets

First, we will load our packages and example datasets. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load packages

# Read in example SDTMv datasets

```

# Validation

All functions are reviewed and tested to ensure that they work as described in
the documentation. They are **not validated** yet.

# Starting a Script

`{datacutr}` provides a template R scripts as a starting point. 

# Support
