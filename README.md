SDTM Cut in R Asset Library

## Purpose

To provide an open source, modularized toolbox that enables the pharmaceutical programming community
to apply a data cut to SDTM data in R.

## Installation

The package is currently under development, installation details will be added soon.

## Main Goal

Provide users with an open source, modularized toolbox with which to apply a data cut to SDTM data in R. 
_As opposed to a “run 1 line and all cut SDTM appear” black-box solution._

One of the key aspects of `{datacutr}` is its development by the users for the users.
It gives an entry point for all to collaborate, co-create and contribute to a consistent approach of 
cutting SDTM data in R, whilst also allowing flexibility to update to study specific needs where needed. 

## Scope

This package works with tabulation data following an SDTMv standard (i.e. no supplemental qualifier domains). The user has 
the flexibility to choose style of cut applied to the individual domain (either no cut, patient cut, xxSTDTC and xxDTC cut, special DM cut 
and special FA cut). 

## References and Documentation

The package is currently under development, references and documentation details will be added soon.
